# Continuous Integration

"At regular intervals, the process of "continuous integration" yields executable releases that grow in functionality at 
every release. ... It is through these milestones that management can measure progress and quality, and hence 
anticipate, identify, and then actively attach risks on an ongoing basis." 
-- _GradyBooch_, **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, 2nd ed.**
